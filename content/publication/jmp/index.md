abstract: I analyze how Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs) shape fertility decisions by estimating a instrumental variable model that explicitly accounts for CPC location choices. CPCs provide abstinence education and counseling services from a “pro-life” (anti-abortion) perspective. I integrate a 30-year panel of CPCs and abortion providers with demographic group-level fertility outcomes in North Carolina and South Carolina. My results show that CPCs increase the local birth rate by 14.2 percent and lower the abortion rate by 30 percent. The effect is concentrated among girls between the ages of 10 and 19. These results align with the CPC objective to alter girls' and women’s abortion preferences and the CPC provision of abortion alternatives (adoption services). CPCs also make it more likely that a pregnancy occurs because the absolute increase in the birth rate is greater than the drop in the abortion rate. This is best explained by sexual abstinence education programs that inadvertently increase risky sexual behavior among high schoolers.
