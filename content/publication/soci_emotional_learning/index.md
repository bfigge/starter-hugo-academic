abstract: The term “social-emotional learning” (SEL) was coined in 1994.  While specific definitions vary, it generally refers to the process of developing interpersonal skills, self-awareness, and the self-control that are important to success in school and beyond. The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) has established five specific core competencies in social-emotional learning: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making.  CASEL’s logic model (CASEL, 2008) suggests that SEL can promote positive academic outcomes through both direct and indirect pathways. By promoting the core competencies, they reason that SEL will allow individual students to take greater advantage of classroom learning, students will be less likely to disrupt peers, and there will be a more positive school learning environment. It is also argued that SEL will produce greater attachment to school and reduce engagement in risky behaviors, which indirectly enhance student academic success.  While the integration of social-emotional learning within schools’ curricula has been growing for many years, concerns over social isolation and the mental well-being of students during the COVID-19 pandemic have heightened interest in social-emotional learning (Yoder et al., 2020).
